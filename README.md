# Woking-with-pandas-and-matplotlib

I have created a jupyter notebook in my VS code text editor and wrote code . Firstly I imported pandas and matplotlib libraries using pip command then I read the bigmart data which is in .csv format. I wrote code to plot many graphs like the usual graph , Histogram, outlier of histogram, scatter plot, pie plots etc.
